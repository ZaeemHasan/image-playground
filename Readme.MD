Note: Python scripts are written using Python3, therefore, Python3 interpreter is required. Furthermore, the scripts utilize functions from Pillow library therefore 'pip install Pillow' is required if the library is not already installed.

Sample command:

- python pillow-lib-playground.py
- python JPGtoPNGconverter.py sourceFolder/ destinationFolder/

Please keep in mind that the '/' after the sourceFolder and destinationFolder are necessary, so that the script can read the images from sourceFolder, and then save them on destinationFolder.
